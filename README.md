# Customer-Engagement-Analysis-
Developed a customer engagement analytics report using McGill University's University Advancement Department as a case study, leveraging alumni engagement data to enhance the effectiveness of their fundraising initiatives.

## Background
University Advancement (UA) staff collaborates with the faculties, schools and departments of McGill University to meet the goals of the institution. UA’s many programs and activities help the University
establish and maintain strong relationships with alumni, donors and potential donors. These relationships are established and maintained through two primary arms of University Advancement: Fundraising and Alumni Engagement. McGill relies on philanthropic support to support its operations, with University
Advancement being responsible for securing these donations and nurturing a culture of philanthropy from its alumni and broader community.


## Alumni Engagement and Annual Giving
Alumni Engagement and Annual Giving serves as a link between McGill and its thousands of graduate worldwide. The team uses signature annual events like Homecoming, as well as Montreal-based and regional branch activities to help alumni remain connected with the University or find opportunities for
online interaction and networking with fellow graduates. The Annual Giving side, meanwhile, reaches out to alumni, parents, and friends of the University through a multichannel Annual Giving program to secure
philanthropic support for the University and showcase the importance that small gifts have on the continued success of McGill.
